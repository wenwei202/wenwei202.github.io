Paper accepted by ICCV 2017, Venice, Italy \[[paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Wen_Coordinating_Filters_for_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf)\]\[[code](https://github.com/wenwei202/caffe)\]\[[poster](https://github.com/wenwei202/caffe/blob/master/docs/ICCV17-Poster.pdf)\]. This is a work to make Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) run faster after deployment. We proposed ***Force Regularization*** to train DNNs towards lower-rank space for more aggressive low-rank approximation.
