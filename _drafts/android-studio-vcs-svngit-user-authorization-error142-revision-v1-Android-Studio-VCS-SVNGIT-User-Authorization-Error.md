[This tutorial](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~campbell/cs65/svn/androidstudio.html) is also most perfect except that the user authorization fails and android studio keeps asking username and password.

To fix this problem:

Mac OS :  
1\) go to Android Studio -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Version Control -&gt; Subversion;  
2\) uncheck Use command line client and Use system default Subversion configuration directory.

Windows:  
Corresponding checkboxs are under File -&gt; Settings
