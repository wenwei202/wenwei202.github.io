SVN  
Create a branch:

```
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="shell">export url=$(svn info | grep URL | awk '{print $2}') #get url
echo $url
export newurl=$url/../branches/path
svn mkdir --parents $newurl -m 'mkdir of branch'
svn copy $url  $newurl -m 'create branch' # add "-r466" option to branch from specific branch
cd your/local/branch/path
svn co $newurl

# remove branch
svn delete http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch -m "Removing obsolete branch of calc project."


```

```
<pre class="EnlighterJSRAW" data-enlighter-language="shell">svn log # list all commit records
svn diff -r 455:462 # diff two versions
```

# Merging an upstream repository into your fork
git checkout master # Check out the branch you wish to merge to
git pull https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git BRANCH_NAME # This will pull remote files to local and may conflicts with your modification [ See how to solve conflicts: https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-from-the-command-line/]
